        <p>
          Flow state is a space where the body-mind relationship is exposed. It gives you the opportunity to explore
          and to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is a place to learn, Flow State doesn’t provide an answer for how your body-mind relationship
          should be. After all I can only draw on my own knowledge and experience, which is very personal and highly
          biased. What Flow State does offer is a place where you can encounter the body-mind relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially the installation functions as a discussion piece. It allows us to experience and address something
          that is usually hidden by habits. This is how it will function in the movie and during the exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long run it can become like a shrine for the body-mind relationship. It can be a space that helps us
          to encounter it and explore it. Like what improvisation does for me Flow State can become for others. A
          place we feel save to experiment and that we can go back to whenever we feel curious. And once you feel
          ready you can take this exploration outside of Flow State and into your daily life.

          <h2>The manifest</h2>
          <p>
            Flow State started with the question, how can I create an environment that reacts to the movements of the
            body? To find
            an answer I collected movements and explored how they could be connected together. The flick of a finger
            or the flex of
            a foot becomes linked to the rising and falling of ‘wings’. The folding of two pieces of wood becomes a
            joint effort
            with the press of a hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resulting collection of movements embodies my research, but it also became a method to create endless
            choreographies
            and compositions. Using pulleys and ropes I connect points across space and make them move together. By
            defining how
            these different points relate to each other I can design how they will move.
